3D-QuickSort
============

An OpenGL visualization of the Quicksort algorithm. Does not make as much use of 3D space as I planned for, but it has the basics down.


Check out Release.zip to run. Contact me if you are interested in compiling.

Uses the following external libraries:
AntTweakBar (for menu)
freeglut
FreeImage (for image loading)
glew
glm

Controls:
Space pauses the animation
Once paused, 's' can step through animation.
'f' toggles front view.
